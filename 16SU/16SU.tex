\Task{Check that reading in fits is comparable to png.  We want to use fits because these are floats, instead of unsigned integer (in png)}
\DoneMiniTask{Use getdata from https://pythonhosted.org/pyfits/ to read in fits as 2d array.  \textbf{This is a PrimaryHDU type, and not easy to compare with float. Also, need to index the 0th entry to get the same np.shape of 300,300}}
\DoneMiniTask{Compare the shapes of 2d array from getdata and imread on png}
\DoneMiniTask{Change the piece of code from imread to getdata. \textbf{Actually, changing to the astropy.io.fits.  Should be similar to getdata, but returns a 300,300 numpy array of floats.}}
\DoneMiniTask{Debug problem: ``map.error: [Errno 24] Too many open files''. \textbf{Googled solution is to use .copy because the list appending keeps files open}}
\DoneMiniTask{Issue with reading in fits: ``raise ValueError(``Images of type float must be between -1 and 1.'') ``: https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/1627 $\rightarrow$ \textbf{I just normalized by the maximum in each image}}
